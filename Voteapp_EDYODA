1. go to root (cd /root/ ) . (both Master and Worker can perform this in their instances)

2. git clone https://github.com/ashishrpandey/example-voting-app

[root@ip-172-31-17-249 ~]# git clone https://github.com/ashishrpandey/example-voting-app

3. go to /root/example-voting-app/k8s-specifications

[root@ip-172-31-17-249 ~]# cd /root/example-voting-app/k8s-specifications

4. [root@ip-172-31-7-102 k8s-specifications]# kubectl apply -f .

5. for voting and result pods, Observe that NodePort is assigned.

6. take your publicIP (your instance IP) : NodePort â–º open 2 browsers , one for VOTING and one for Results.
it's working.


7 try voting and see the results paralelly in results page.
it's working as per vote.


8. Now try to delete the Pods one by one (first voting Pod, then worker pod, then db pod) and see what happens to the voting and result app after deleting.

after deleting voting Pod, no connectivity issue observed for result app while connectivity issue observed momentry and connected to new pod.
after deleting worker Pod, no connectivity issue observed for result app while connectivity issue observed momentry and connected to new pod.
after deleting db Pod, deleting db pod, both voting and worker pod got restart. One observation, post deletion % voting for cats/dog showing changed to 50% while earlier it was 100/0 %. New db pod created as while crateion RS is being used for craeting db pod.
